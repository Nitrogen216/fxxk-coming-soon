## 2️⃣ Background
In recent years, more and more research papers release GitHub repositories with only a **"Coming Soon"** message, or they choose not to release any code at all.  
This greatly slows down reproducibility and the progress of open science.

**fxxk-coming-soon** provides an optimized prompt framework that enables LLMs to generate comprehensive, structured documentation from research papers. This documentation is specifically designed to guide Claude Code through autonomous paper reproduction with minimal human intervention.

---

## 3️⃣ Core Innovation
- 🎯 **Optimized Prompt Engineering**: Advanced prompt template specifically designed for Claude Code autonomous implementation
- 🧠 **Systematic Paper Analysis**: Structured framework for extracting key implementation details from research papers
- 📄 **Comprehensive Documentation Generation**: Creates 4 interconnected `.md` files with executable specifications
- 🤖 **Autonomous-Ready Output**: Documentation includes specific function signatures, dependency maps, and validation checkpoints
- 🛠️ **Seamless Integration**: Generated docs serve as complete blueprints for Claude Code implementation

---

## 4️⃣ Usage Workflow
1. 📑 **Prepare the paper**  
   Extract the relevant sections (especially the methodology) from the English research paper.

2. 📝 **Get the Prompt**  
   Open [`PAPER_TO_CODE_PROMPT.md`](PAPER_TO_CODE_PROMPT.md) in this repository.

3. 🚀 **Generate Documentation**  
   Combine the paper content with the optimized prompt template and input into a capable LLM. The prompt includes systematic analysis frameworks and quality validation checklists.

4. 💾 **Save the Generated Documentation**  
   The LLM will produce four interconnected files:
   - `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Complete architectural blueprint with exact specifications
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Sequential development roadmap with specific Claude Code tasks
   - `DATA_AND_EVAL.md` - Comprehensive data handling and evaluation protocols
   - `RISKS_AND_NOTES.md` - Proactive guidance for implementation challenges  
   Save them into your project workspace.

5. 🛠️ **Autonomous Implementation**  
   Launch Claude Code in the project folder. The generated documentation provides all necessary specifications for autonomous implementation, including function signatures, dependency maps, testing procedures, and validation checkpoints.
